# Day 5 -Assignments

## Question 1: Array Initialization and Access
1. Initialize an array of integers with the first 5 natural numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5).
2. Write a program to print each element of the array using a loop.

## Question 2: Slice Manipulation
1. Create a slice of integers containing the numbers 10 to 20.
2. Append the numbers 21, 22, and 23 to the slice.
3. Print the slice before and after the append operation.

## Question 3: Map Creation and Access
1. Create a map where the keys are names of countries and the values are their capital cities.
2. Add at least 3 country-capital pairs to the map.
3. Write a program to print the capital of a specific country (e.g., "France").

## Question 4: Checking Key Existence in a Map
1. Create a map with string keys and integer values representing a collection of items and their quantities.
2. Check if a specific item exists in the map and print an appropriate message.

## Question 5: Struct Definition and Usage
1. Define a struct named `Car` with fields for brand, model, and year.
2. Create an instance of the `Car` struct and print its fields.

## Question 6: Slicing an Array
1. Create an array of integers with 10 elements.
2. Create a slice from the array containing only the first 5 elements.
3. Modify the slice and print both the slice and the original array to observe changes.

## Question 7: Combining Structs with Maps
1. Define a struct named `Student` with fields for name, age, and grade.
2. Create a map where the keys are student IDs (strings) and the values are `Student` structs.
3. Add at least 2 students to the map and write a program to print the details of each student.

## Question 8: Nested Slices and Maps
1. Create a map where the keys are strings representing categories (e.g., "Fruits", "Vegetables") and the values are slices of strings representing items in those categories.
2. Add at least 2 categories with 3 items each.
3. Write a program to print all the items under each category.
